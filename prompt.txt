My proudest achievement so far was during my time as an Insurance Agent at AAA, where I was able to leverage my CS background to become the #1 performing agent in a the region (California, out of 255 agents, Jan-Feb 2024).
When I first stared in insurance sales, I was transitioning from my Bachelor program. I was relatively new to sales and in a very competitive environment. My goal wasn't just to sell, but to systematically study about the American life through big data, which AAA uniquely offers. At AAA, they use Salesforce CRM, which took me a very short time to study and master. So, I applied my analytical skills: I tracked my sales data, identified patterns in successful conversions and lead sources, and then used those insights to optimize my sales strategy, focusing my efforts where they'd have the most impact. This data-driven approach led me to peak at #1 in the region and consistently stay in the top 3% producer. It was my proudest moment because it showed me the power of applying analytical thinking to achieve excellence, even in a field outside of traditional tech. It proved that a systematic pursuit of improvement yields tangible results.
